# Prototype Website
A minimalist prototype website built using HTML and CSS, enhanced with the Bootstrap CSS framework and jQuery for DOM manipulations. This website is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes.

## Features
### Navigation Bar
- A transparent navigation bar that blends with the white background, minimizing clutter and providing a visually pleasing experience.
- The navigation bar includes a logo on the far left that redirects to the home page and six tabs: Home, About, Projects, Team, Contact, and Careers.
- The Team tab features a dropdown menu with options for "Board Members" and "Staff". Currently, the "Home" and "Board Members" tabs are functional.
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar transforms into a button that displays the navigation links in a full-screen modal. The Team dropdown becomes a collapsible button for a more efficient design in this context.
### Home Page
- An automatically sliding carousel that transitions images every 2 seconds. It includes next and previous navigation buttons that pause the automatic sliding for 5 seconds when clicked, resetting the timer upon user interaction.
- Quick navigation links at the bottom of the carousel allow users to jump to any desired slide.
- Fully responsive design that scales appropriately with screen size.
### Team Page
- A page featuring a list of cards, each displaying introductory information about a team member. Clicking a card reveals more details in a modal, which can be closed by clicking outside the modal.
- Fully responsive layout, with the number of cards per row adjusting to screen size (from a maximum of 4 cards per row to a minimum of 1).
## Design
The website follows a minimalist design philosophy, using a simple black and white color scheme and smooth animations to ensure an intuitive, easy-to-navigate, and visually comfortable user experience.
